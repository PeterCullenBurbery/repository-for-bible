(14:24) Now to him who is able to establish you according to my Good News and the preaching of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret through long ages, (14:25) but now is revealed, and by the Scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment of the eternal God, is made known for obedience of faith to all the nations; (14:26) to the only wise God, through Jesus Christ, to whom be the glory forever! Amen.
516|Romans|015|003|"For even Christ didn't please himself.  But, as it is written, ""The reproaches of those who reproached you fell on me."""

522|Romans|015|014|I myself am also persuaded about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness, filled with all knowledge, able also to admonish others.

529|Corinthians 1|001|010|Now I beg you, brothers, through the name of our Lord, Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be perfected together in the same mind and in the same judgment.

531|Corinthians 1|001|031|"that, according as it is written, ""He who boasts, let him boast in the Lord."""

538|Corinthians 1|009|009|"For it is written in the law of Moses, ""You shall not muzzle an ox while it treads out the grain."" Is it for the oxen that God cares,"

548|Corinthians 1|015|050|Now I say this, brothers, that flesh and blood can't inherit the Kingdom of God; neither does corruption inherit incorruption.

566|Galatians|003|011|"Now that no man is justified by the law before God is evident, for, ""The righteous will live by faith."""

589|Thessalonians 2|001|003|We are bound to always give thanks to God for you, brothers, even as it is appropriate, because your faith grows exceedingly, and the love of each and every one of you towards one another abounds;
590|Thessalonians 2|001|012|that the name of our Lord Jesus may be glorified in you, and you in him, according to the grace of our God and the Lord Jesus Christ.
591|Timothy 1|003|001|This is a faithful saying:  if a man seeks the office of an overseer, he desires a good work.
592|Timothy 1|003|008|Servants, in the same way, must be reverent, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not greedy for money;

594|Timothy 1|003|012|Let servants be husbands of one wife, ruling their children and their own houses well.
595|Timothy 1|003|013|For those who have served well gain for themselves a good standing, and great boldness in the faith which is in Christ Jesus.

633|Hebrews|011|013|These all died in faith, not having received the promises, but having seen them and embraced them from afar, and having confessed that they were strangers and pilgrims on the earth.

637|Hebrews|011|035|Women received their dead by resurrection. Others were tortured, not accepting their deliverance, that they might obtain a better resurrection.
638|Hebrews|011|037|They were stoned. They were sawn apart. They were tempted.  They were slain with the sword. They went around in sheep skins and in goat skins; being destitute, afflicted, ill-treated
